# Calculator
This is a calculator written in python with the goal of supporting all features I can think of

Running Expression.py with start a calculator repl

repl commands:
#EXIT or #QUIT: exits the repl
#SETVAR x: will allow you to set the value of the variable specified for use in later expressions

calculator commands:
x + y: adds x and y
x - y: subtracts x and y
x * y: multiplies x and y
x / y: divides x and y
x ^ y: raises x to the yth power
fun x: calls a function "fun" with the parameter x
let x = y in z: evaluates z with the variable x being set to y
let fun x = y in z: evaulates z with the function "fun" being set to y with the parameter x
(x): evaluates x before any surrounding operations
